## Get started

Welcome to the API reference documentation for the Saasfy API.

The Saasfy API is organized around REST. Our API has predictable resource-oriented URLs,
accepts form-encoded request bodies, returns JSON-encoded responses, and uses standard HTTP response codes, authentication, and verbs.

## Authentication

To authenticate with the Saasfy API, you need to provide an API key in the `Authorization` header of your request.

```http
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
```

You can find your API key in the [Saasfy dashboard](https://app.saasfy.dev/settings/tokens).
